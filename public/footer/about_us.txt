About Us

Every year, new tools promise to change the way real estate is done. But most of them are either too complicated, too generic, or disconnected from the realities of an agent’s day-to-day work. Realtors end up juggling CRMs, spreadsheets, and endless follow-ups — wasting hours on cold leads and missed opportunities.

PropMatch AI was built to change that. Founded in 2024, our team set out to solve one of the biggest challenges in real estate: knowing which homeowners are actually ready to sell, and how to connect with them in the smartest way possible. We combine predictive analytics, market insights, and AI-powered messaging to help professionals focus on leads that convert — not leads that drain time.

We’ve felt the frustration ourselves. As builders, technologists, and industry partners, we know what it’s like to face outdated workflows, unclear data, and guesswork when it comes to prospecting. That’s why PropMatch AI isn’t just another software tool. It’s designed as the intelligent layer that simplifies decision-making, streamlines outreach, and gives agents the confidence to act with precision.

Our mission is simple: Redefine real estate through AI-driven tools for smarter connections and predictive insights. From solo agents to entire brokerages, PropMatch AI empowers professionals to navigate the market with efficiency, accuracy, and results.

We are a small but dedicated team of innovators based in Canada — working at the intersection of AI, PropTech, real estate, and technology — and we’re just getting started.
